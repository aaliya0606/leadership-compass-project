# Using Git As A Group (DevMountain)

#### Geordyn Ader - Mentor - Dallas, TX Campus

## Getting Started - Choose ONE person from your group to take care of the following steps

1. Go to GitHub and click the + in the top right corner. Click New Organization.
2. Name your organization (make it relevant).
3. Add email for ‘billing’; do not worry, it’s free
4. Choose the Free Plan
5. It’ll take you to a new page. Now add everyone in your team onto the group (including your mentor).
  * Everyone will have to accept the invitation via email/GitHub notification.
6. Now, create a repository. This is what your group will push to.
  * Whoever creates the group needs to be sure to give admin access to each team member, including mentors.
  * Simply go to the organization, then people, then manage access for each member.
7. Last, this same person needs to create a very small file tree.
  * The group needs to agree on a directory structure.
  * Keep your directory and file names consistent and organized. This will save you trouble down the road
  * The person creating the file structure can do it on the master branch and push it.
  * After this, **never** work on master again.

##### _EACH TEAM MEMBER MUST CLONE THE PROJECT — DO NOT FORK IT!_

Alright, now let's make a branch and code.

## Setting Up Your Branches

*Before creating a new branch, make sure you are up to date with the master branch. Simply:*

```sh
$ git pull origin master
```

Don’t ever work on the master branch. Let’s refresh your memories on how to make branches:

```sh
$ git checkout -b branchName
```

> Tip: Each branch should be made based on each feature, not page. For example, some branches could be:
> fbAuth,
> editUserInfo,
> addingGulp,
> etc.

When you make a branch, it's only created locally. So, we need to make it exist on
your remote so your team members can see it.

```sh
$ git push --set-upstream origin sameBranchName
```

This will make your branch visible on GitHub to other team members and set the upstream to push to
your specific branch. Double check to make sure your new branch is there by going to your
organization on GitHub, then to branches.

## Adding, Committing, and Pushing

##### If you've completed the steps above, you're ready to code on your branch now!

*You add and commit your files the same way you've always done it when you’re on a branch, but:*

> BEFORE YOU COMMIT, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON YOUR BRANCH, NOT MASTER.

After you add and commit your files, push your changes to your branch on GitHub:

```sh
$ git push origin sameBranchName
```

##### Now, if you’re ready to make a pull request in order to merge your branch's code with Master, head over to GitHub:

* _Your Organization >> Branches >> Your Branch >> Compare & Pull Request_
* NEVER MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST UNTIL SOMEONE IN YOUR GROUP APPROVES IT!

## Merging Master Into Your Branch

You should keep your branch up-to-date with master. First, commit any changes on your branch.
Make sure your work in good shape and committed, so it won't be a difficult process if there are conflicts.

```sh
# on your branch
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m “blah"
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
```

Now, merge your branch with master. There could be conflicts if you haven't been pulling regularly.
No worries, this can usually be fixed in just a few minutes.

```sh
$ git checkout branchName
$ git merge master
```

#### If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to start over, you can recover:

```sh
# on your branch
$ git merge --abort
```

## Deleting Branches

When you are finished with a feature, and everything has been merged with the master branch via pull request,
you should delete your branch associated with that feature locally and on GitHub to keep things clean and organized.
You can delete it manually on GitHub by going to the organization then to branches, or you can delete it with:

```sh
$ git push origin :BranchName
```

The difference from before is simply the colon :

To delete your branch locally:

```sh
$ git branch -d branchName
```

To FORCE branch deletion locally:

```sh
$ git branch -D branchName
```

And to prune local references to deleted branches:

```sh
$ git remote prune origin
```

### _Important Reminders:_

* Tell your team every time a pull request has been merged with master. Don’t let your team members fall behind master.
* Pull often, just to be sure. Even if no one has told you about changes on master, pull anyways. It doesn’t hurt.
* Under Branches on GitHub you can find a visual representation of how far behind or head your branch is from master.
* Double check with team members before merging.
* Make sure you are on a branch before you start working. Get in the habit of checking.
